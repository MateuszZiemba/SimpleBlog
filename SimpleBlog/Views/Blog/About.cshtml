    <p>This is a simple blog, written to get a grasp of how to create basic ASP.NET MVC websites. It was developed based on this tutorial: http://prideparrot.com/blog/archive/2012/12/how_to_create_a_simple_blog_part1 There are some differences though, all of the CRUD was written in Entity Framework, and it was not copy-pasted, but rather used as a guide</p>
